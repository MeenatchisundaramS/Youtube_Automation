ðŸ“„ Project Description: YouTube Video Upload Automation
Overview:
This Python project automates the process of uploading videos to YouTube using Selenium WebDriver. It is designed to save time and effort by handling the entire upload processâ€”from selecting a video file to setting its title, description, and visibilityâ€”without requiring manual navigation through YouTube Studio.

Functionality:
When the script is executed, it prompts the user to choose a video file from their computer using a file dialog. After that, it asks for a custom title and description. The automation then opens the Chrome browser, navigates to YouTube Studio, uploads the selected video, and sets its visibility to Unlisted by default. Once the upload is complete, the browser is closed automatically.

Use Case:
This tool is especially useful for content creators, educators, and developers who regularly upload videos and wish to simplify or batch the process. By removing the need for repeated manual actions, the script helps users focus on content creation rather than the logistics of publishing.

User Experience:
No prior experience with YouTube APIs or browser automation is necessary. The script provides a simple and interactive flow that anyone with basic Python knowledge can run. The interface is intuitive, and the upload process mimics a real user interaction with YouTube, making it reliable even without API access.

Responsibility:
As the script interacts with a private web service, itâ€™s important to use it responsibly and in accordance with YouTubeâ€™s terms of service. This tool is intended for personal productivity and not for spamming, mass uploads, or violating platform policies.
